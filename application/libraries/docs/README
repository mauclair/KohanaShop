 Stegger - Simple But Secure Steganography For PHP

    Introduction

        Steganography is the art (and science) of hiding data within an image file. The
        reasons should be fairly obvious, you have something you want to hide, and the
        best place to hide something is in the last place anyone will look for it, right
        under thier nose. Simply put, a secret is not a secret if everyone knows about it.

    How to use it

        This is a short run through of how to use the class, for anything not covered
        here read the source code, it is heavily commented.

        1. First things first you should either include the Stegger class in your script
           or paste the contents of the Stegger file into your PHP file, its as simple as..

           include_once('Stegger.class.inc.php');

        2. Now we need to create the Stegger object so we can use it, you can call the
           object whatever you want, for this example I will be calling it $Stegger.

           $Stegger = new Stegger();

        3. Before we can get to hiding data in an image we need to know where or what it
           is, Stegger will take data as a file upload, path or URL to file, plain text
           messages or multiple files through a glob style string (/*.txt).

                - Path to local file(s) eg:

                    Linux:
                    /home/something/secretfile.txt
                    /path/to/all/files/like/*.txt

                    Windows:
                    C:/Windows/but/with/bars/secretfile.txt
                    C:/Windows/can/do/this/too/*.txt

                - URL to remote file

                    ftp://username:passwizord@ftp.ihopethisonedoesntexist.com/secretfile.txt
                    ssh2.sftp://username:passwizord@ilovemesomeesefteepee.com:22/secretfile.txt
                    http://www.secretfiles.com/secretfile.txt
                    https://www.secureURL.com/secretfle.txt

                - File upload through PHP

                    $_FILES['secretfile']

                - Text messages

                    Hey,
                    Meet me at the place at 12!

           For this example we will be hiding a file uploaded through a form, for more
           examples please check the optional extras section of this file, please note
           that you can just pass the file directly and do not need to assign it to
           another variable, I am just doing it for clarity.

           $SecretData = $_FILES['secretfile'];

        4. Now that we have the data we want to hide we need to get the image, just like
           with the secret data you can supply an image in different ways, for this example
           we will be using a URL but you can use paths or file uploads as well.

           $Image = 'http://secret.someURL.com/image.jpg';

        5. Stegger allows encryption using a build in encryption scheme that uses a public
           and private key, the public key can be set in the Stegger source file but you
           need to provide the private key at run time.

           $Key = 'Wow this is a very very very long key that I am typing';

        6. Ok its time to let Stegger work its magic, there is only one method to call.

           $Stegger->Put($SecretData, $Image, $Key);

           The image will automatically be output to the users browser to be downloaded.
           If your script is used from the command line or you just want to save the
           encoded image somewhere on the server you can supply a path to save the image
           to, if you use the script from the command line you must provide the output
           path.

           $Stegger->Put($SecretData, $Image, $Key, '/some/local/path/image.png');

           The key and output path parameters are optional, at the very least you just
           have to provide an image and something to hide.

        7. To get our secret data back out of the image we use a method that works
           much like the Put() method except it does not need the secret data parameter.

           $Stegger->Get($Image, $Key);

           If you have multiple files or if you are using a script from the command line
           you need to specify an output path.

           $Stegger->Get($Image, $Key, '/save/files/to/this/path/');

    Optional extras

        As you may have noticed above, Stegger is pretty flexible in the way it takes
        certain parameters, you can provide PHP file upload variables, paths and URLs
        but there is one more trick up Stegger's sleeve, you can supply more than
        one file upload, URL, message or path by passing them as an array, for
        a better understanding look at the small example below.

        // Instantiate the Stegger object
        $Stegger = new Stegger();

        // We want to hide all the .txt files in this directory and a php file from another
        $SecretData[] = '/some/path/to/files/*.txt';
        $SecretData[] = '/some/path/to/files/file.php';

        // Download two files from the internet and hide them
        $SecretData[] = 'http://some.URL.com/secretfile1.txt';
        $SecretData[] = 'ftp://some.URL2.com/secretfile2.txt';

        // We will also be hiding a file that was uploaded through a form
        $SecretData[] = $_FILES['secretfile'];

        // And we will encode a little message to the person who will decode this
        $SecretData[] = "Heya,\n You can find the stuff in the thing\nThanks";

        // And that is all there is to it
        $Stegger->Put($SecretData, 'http://some.image.com/image.gif');

    How it works

        Steganography isn't as hard as it sounds, there are many methods one can use to
        hide data within an image, none of them are right or wrong but some have more
        limitations than others. Before I can get into how it's done in this class I
        feel it is important to discuss the other methods.

        By far the easiest way to hide data within an image is to store it in the comment
        field of the image file, this is not an ideal method at all. Even if you could get
        past the fact that the data will be trivial to find you will probably find that
        the 255 bytes of space (on average) is not enough to store anything worthwhile.
        This method also requires special knowledge of the specific image type of the
        image you wish to hide the data inside.

        Another method that is frequently employed for steganography is to utilise the
        unused space allocated for colour information (a 32 bit colour often only uses
        24 bits of space). A variation of this method is to use the space allocated for
        transparency (the alpha channel, which yields 7 bits of data per pixel) but
        that depends on the image type and if it uses alpha blending or a real alpha
        channel. Although data hidden with these methods is harder to find it can still
        be detected by the trained eye or some specialist tools, once someone finds
        that the unused space has been used they know there is secret data, which means
        even if your data is protected with encryption, we have failed since all this
        steganography stuff is about being evasive and keeping the data hidden.

        The method employed by the Stegger class is different to the above methods in
        that it does not store data in any empty space within the image. If that does
        not make much sense to you yet, don't  worry, read on.

        The best way to learn about something is to understand the fundementals of its
        seperate parts, in steganography there are two parts we need to learn about,
        the image (in which we will be hiding data) and the data (which we will be
        hiding inside the image). At the most basic level, all images are made up of
        pixels (also known by thier not so cool name, picture elements), each pixel
        is basically a tiny little block that displays a colour and all colours are
        made up from a combination of the three primary colours, red, green and blue.
        Each pixel holds information about these three primary colours to work out
        what colour it should be, each primary colour in a (32 bit or 24 bit) pixel
        takes up 1 byte of data which means each primary colour is represented by
        a number between 0 (no colour) and 255 (full colour). So the colour white
        on your computer screen is not a lack of all colour, rather, it is all the
        primary colours turned on full blast (red: 255, green: 255, blue: 255).

        Stegger takes advantage of these image basics to hide data by altering the
        value of each primary colour in each pixel to either reflect a 1 or a 0,
        because as you should know, all digital data is just a sequence of 1's and
        0's, binary. There are a number of ways to alter a number to represent a
        1 or a 0, the method that Stegger (and some other tools) uses is to alter
        the number to be either odd or even, this allows us to store 1 bit of data
        in every primary colour which means we store 3 bits of data symbolically
        within each pixel.

        Now 3 bits per pixel might not sound like enough to hide data but if you
        consider that an 800 x 600 pixel image has 480 000 pixels and that we can
        spread the data through-out some or all of those pixels, we have a viable
        way of storing data in an image (that 800 x 600 pixel image would allow
        us to store about 175KB of data with compression that could mean over a
        Megabyte of text data).

        The advantage of this method is that the data is stored symbolically which
        means an attacker has no way of knowing for sure if each pixel is representing
        some data or if that is infact the way the image was made.

        There are limitations to this method however, namely, the image needs to
        be saved in a lossless format or the data we have symbolically stored inside
        the image will be lost or mangled. This does not mean this method cannot be
        used for formats like JPEG and GIF, but to work with those formats rather
        than assigning an odd or even number per primary colour in a pixel you would
        need to look for the closest odd or even number in the colour index of the
        image and you would need to make sure there were not too many similar colours
        in the colour index or they will be lost when the image is saved, it is for
        this reason that Stegger saves all encoded images as a PNG, which is lossless.

        Please look at the images in the docs/images/ directory for a graphical summary
        of what was said above.

    How is this useful

        Steganography has a stigma attached to it, its cool but ultimately useless,
        that may be the case if you have nothing to be evasive about or no one to
        evade (which means you're either a saint or naive, possibly both) but for
        everyone else steganography can be not only a cool tool, but a useful one too.

        Sometimes encryption is not enough, sometimes we want to hide the fact that we
        even have data to encrypt. Imagine for a minute that you have reason to believe
        your connection is being sniffed, perhaps its part of your work/univeristy/isp's
        security policy, if you were to just merely encrypt the data and it was to be
        intercepted between point A and point B, sure your data would be relatively
        safe (assuming the person who intercepted it isn't the type to link up a few
        boxes and try crack the data for 8 months) but you would have let the attacker
        know something very valuable, that you have something to hide and whilst they
        may not be able to get the decrypted data, they will have an incentive to keep
        digging and watch you. If we were to use the same analogy but this time instead
        of sending an encrypted file you send a joke image to a friend that has your
        secret data encrypted and encoded inside, the email with the image attached
        would be sniffed but the attacker would simply laugh it off as one of those
        silly joke emails that everyone hates and spend his time looking for more
        obvious targets.

        The most exciting thing about steganography is the fact that web is littered
        with images, you could take an encoded image and send it to one of the large
        free image hosting sites like flickr and imageshack, or make a page on myspace
        about a fictional person and encode secret data into a misc image on the page
        and no one would be the wiser, it could be the most public of places, a million
        people could look at the image everyday and nobody would even look twice.

    Security

        It has been said that security through obscurity is no security at all, whilst
        I think we can all fundementally agree with that point, it needs to be said that
        obscurity does help. Evasion can be a key factor in keeping anything secure, it
        is hard for an attacker to blow something up if they can't find it and even
        harder if they don't know for sure that it exists.

        How many digital images would you say you have seen in your life time? How many
        times when looking at or glancing over a digital image did you wonder what sort of
        secret data was encoded inside it? If you are a normal person (which you might
        not be if you google for steganography applications) you have never wondered
        about secret data encoded in any images, even if you thought about steganography
        regularly, there are just too many images on the internet to know which ones
        to examine closer.

        That being said, evasion is not enough, and this is why every little piece of
        data encoded into an image with Stegger is encrypted with a custom (and that
        means obscure) two way encryption algorithm called Secrypt.

        Although I can't guarantee anything (as the GNU license states), I would be
        extremely suprised if an untrusted party was able to discover your secret data
        inside your image file. I would be even more suprised if that untrusted party
        was able to crack the encryption (assuming you used a strong key). If the data
        was discovered by an attacker I would think that the weak link in the security
        chain was a person and not the steganography method or encyrption scheme used.
